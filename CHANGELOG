Change log for Ruby9i

   Version 0.2.1:

      In BaseTimestamp (basetimestamp.c):

         Changed #to_a to return the day of the week in the range 0-6 rather
         than 1-7 in order to match the functionality of the built-in Time
         class.

         Changed #default_fmt= and #secondprecision= to use the pattern
         /[fF][fF]\d/ rather than /ff\d/ to look for the second-precision
         format string.

      In Database (database.c):

         Fixed #quote.

         Fixed #do.

         Changed #initialize to verify that all arguments are Strings.

      In Datatype (datatype.c):

         Removed some debugging printf() statements accidentally left in the
         previous release.

      In Date (date.c):

         Changed #to_a to return the day of the week in the range 0-6 rather
         than 1-7 in order to match the functionality of the built-in Time
         class.

      In Error (error.c):

         Fixed function error_get_sql_errstr() (called by #to_s) to properly
         extract the line of SQL text on which the error occurred, and
         simplified the code.

      In Handle (handle.c):

         Removed some debugging printf() statements accidentally left in the
         previous release.
