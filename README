The Ruby9i Library

   This is Ruby9i, a Ruby library that provides access to Oracle9i using the
   Oracle Call Interface.  It supports (or is planned to support) all major
   Oracle9i datatypes and object-relational features.  It provides two APIs,
   one implemented in the C extension (the "native" interface), and one
   implemented in a Ruby module that is DBI-compatible. Please visit the home
   of Ruby9i <http://ruby9i.sourceforge.net/> for more information.


Requirements

   The Ruby9i Library was developed using Ruby 1.8.0pre3 and Oracle9i Release 2
   (v9.2.0.1.0) on Mandrake Linux 9.1. It requires an Oracle9i client
   installation.  In addition, building Ruby9i requires the OCI development
   headers.
