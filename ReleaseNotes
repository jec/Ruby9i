Release Notes for the Ruby9i Library v0.2.1
January 25, 2004


General

   The native API is still incomplete and under development. It may change in
   subsequent releases. The goal is to add enhancements only and avoid backward
   incompatibilities at or before release 0.5.0.


Limitations

   Support for the following Oracle features is still missing but planned for
   the 0.3.0 release:

      * LOBs

   Support for the following has been postponed indefinitely due to lack of
   documentation:

      * User-defined types (named types)
      * Collections

   In addition, some basic instance methods for the datatypes are still
   missing, in particular the basic string functionality (such as
   concatenation) for Varchar.

   The standard DBI exception hierarchy has not yet been implemented.


Known Issues

   Aside from the gaps in the API, there are no _known_ bugs.

   Documentation is available on the project Web site. Please visit
